# Tic-Tac-Toe undefeated AI 

Tic-Tac-Toe is one of the very popular game which I enjoyed playing with my friends during my childhood days. Tic-Tac-Toe might look like a simple game, but it involves lot of interesting factor.

This project focuses on creating an AI that would be unbeaten in the Tic-Tac-Toe game, I have decided to use Minimax decision rule which is commonly used in artificial intelligence and game theory concerning zero-sum games. The main idea is to minimise the possible loss in a worst case and thus one individual can gain maximum possible reward while the opponent will use the same process to minimise the reward gained by other.

There will be two main files in this project: board.py and tictactoe.py. 
‘tictactoe.py’ contains all the logic for playing this game. ‘board.py’ contains the code to run the graphical user interface for the game. We can play this TicTac-Toe game against the AI by running the ‘board.py’ python file.
